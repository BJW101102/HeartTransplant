Lore: Well you died. The only salvageable part of your being... was your heart. It was still beating hours after the fact. So can you really be considered dead? you have no body but still have a heart who beats faster than those alive. luckily within this realm of the dead, there are many who still have the will to live. Can you and your outspoken heart reach the minds of those you transplant into.  Only time will tell...

Where: in the deep recesses of the mind.

When: in the space when and after you died

Why: because your heart has more love to give

lover boy: He loved. Fully. So full that not even an empty heart stood a chance. This was however his downfall as no one could receive all his love nor give him enough love. This dissatisfaction lead to his crying heart running out of tears to shed. Even now, after losing his heart, he loves as if it's the only thing he knows.

Dog trainer: Her and her dogs were always together. they were essentially the same being. They had been with her since she was born and vice versa.  Her heart became 1/3 of what it was when they died, so she followed her heart.
